//        What is CSRF? CSRF is a type of attack where unauthorized commands are transmitted from a user that a web application trusts. Spring Security enables CSRF protection by default to prevent this kind of attack.
//                Why disable CSRF?
//        For stateless APIs (such as REST APIs using JWT tokens), you often disable CSRF because there are no sessions or cookies involved in tracking the user state. Since the API is stateless, CSRF is unnecessary.
//        If you're building a traditional web application that uses sessions or forms, CSRF protection is typically left enabled to safeguard against such attacks.
//        By disabling CSRF with csrf.disable(), you're telling Spring Security not to require CSRF tokens for POST, PUT, DELETE, or other non-GET requests. This is commonly done in API-based applications.
